# Outline
- The session begins with Lauran appearing to Fanna again. He asks how Donovan is doing, as he is interested in him, especially given the current events -- The reveal of the plant constructs is making waves across the country, as citizens are concerned about their conception. Weaponry drawing from nature itself is considered an unspoken societal taboo. Lauran feels a sense of kinship with Donovan over their scientific pursuits being considered taboos. This leads him to mentioning that Donovan is key to him perfecting his necromancy.
	- "You know what I want Fanna. The perfect revival."
	- (What does Donovan have to do with a perfect revival?) "That is up to you to find out."
	- After Lauran disappears, Fanna gets a vision of the Taotie's escape from Lauran's wizard tower
- On the trip upriver, Mei reflects on Yinghua's death. She knew that those who die from Frayed Threads are killed forever when trying to protect the others, and likely volunteered to be a distraction to avoid the risk of any of the other party members being annihilated from The Weave.
	- She turns to the closest party member(s) and asks them to answer her truthfully: Do they think Yinghua's death is her fault?
	- Mei also confesses her binding vow: She made Michael promise Nadyn wouldnt hurt another living being, and that if he did, Michael would feel the exact pain the living being felt
- Mei decides to make a stop at the ruins of Cuiguo. There, the Spirits of the past Cuiguo denizens appear and meet her. The Marrionetist smiles, and presents her with a Chinese Puzzle Ball, carved out of ivory, before disappearing. Mei stares at the intricate contraption, confused about its purpose. If not prompted, Mei will seek out Joanna for advice on what exactly the puzzle ball is.
- The party returns to Shengdu and hears of news of General Durand’s arrival, and how he wish to speaks to the leaders of Lingguo, including audience with the Empress. The party notes how he was one of the chief pioneers behind Leferin’s rapid industrialization and rise in the past century.
- They also notice a mass of protesters in front of the entrance to the Inner City: They're calling for the cancellation of the Plant Constructs.
- While walking at the edge of the city, they hear a commotion. A crowd of protesters is scrambling after Donovan, who has his coat up over his head and is hurriedly carrying groceries.
	- If the party helps him, the crowd notices that he seemed to recognize the party, and immediately interrogate the party asking what they know.
- Ljubica and Iskra are at the newly opened inn and restaurant they decided to open together in Shengdu. It serves traditional Yumalyan food as before. Iskra is once again reading a newspaper detailing General Durand’s arrival, and chronicles chaos in Shengdu over a figure in traditional priest robes haunting the streets. It also once again lists of a figure in green hair and purple clothes being spotted fighting the Tigers of Nam.
	- iskra tells the party how ljibuca is hosting a cultural event with the yumalyan culture organization to host a traditional yumaylan feast and ceremony open to the public
- The party receives a letter by carrier bird summoning them to the Eastern(?) Shengdu Temple, which Guiying and her father Hua Tuo (Master Tuo) reside in. Hua Tuo has finally unearthed some substantial information regarding Lauran’s activities and whereabouts: He seems to have been communicating with Ondinia and Leferin recently, and they have exchanged resources and funding. It appears to be similar correspondence to the letters in Ayer's pockets the party pilfered.
	- when hua tuo summons the party, a government official meets them there to get them up to speed with leferin's machinations and lauran
	- when the govt official leaves, master hua informs the party that he's found out lauran has been communicating with leferinese and ondinian scientists
	- when the party talks with hua tuo, all of the other high elves met so far are also present to meet with him
		- [[Lady Sangshu]] - The tailor/seamstress
		- [[Lady Zhenyi]] - The caretaker of the Anshan Nature Reserve
		- [[Sir Haishan]] - The head executioner
- While at the temple, the party overhears as Liu, a member of the other party that Michael mentors, flying in and begging Guiying to help her: His party went into the Spirit World to try and fight the Spirit that’s been haunting the Shengdu streets, but was attacked by a malevolent entity, and Liu barely escaped to fetch help. He can’t find Michael to contact him for help, so he’s asking Guiying.
- Guiying repeats how Michael went on a trip into the Spirit World after his return from investigating upriver, and left Nadyn and Anahe with her.
