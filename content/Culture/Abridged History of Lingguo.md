early settlers of the region -> [[Anshan]] lake area

later settlers spread outward to [[Fengtian]]/[[Sitian]] area, [[Yue]]/[[Ai ]] area, [[Liya]]/[[Nam]] area

fengtian/sitian settlers expand westward again, conquer most of area up to the yumalyan border. modern [[Lingguo]] identity emerges. anshan, yue, and ai have distinct cultures but still generally under the lingguo umbrella. nam/liya have more independent identities. [[Jongqu]] and [[Zuang]] develop unique culture due to mix of yumalyan and lingguoren influence. [[Beidao]] develops own unique independent culture with some lingguoren influence.

*various dynasties later*
