## Northeastern Lingguoren
**(Standard) Lingguoren**
The standard dialect of Lingguoren. What you'd read in the newspaper, academia, most literature, and hear on the magitech equivalent radio. Essentially "Common" for the purposes of this campaign. Based off the Fengtian and Sitian dialects.

**Bai Lingguoren**
Highly mutually intelligible with Standard Lingguoren. Closely related enough to Standard Lingguoren to not be considered a fully separate language, although there are theories that it is slowly developing into its own separate language.

## Central-Southern Lingguoren
**Anshanese (Central Lingguoren)**
A distinct language of Lingguo, often called a dialect, but the term is misleading, as there is significant differences and low mutual intelligibility between Lingguoren and Anshanese. In the same family as Ai and Yue Lingguoren, but Ai and Yue Lingguoren are closer to each other than either to Anshanese. Belongs to the Central branch of the Central-Southern Lingguoren Languages. Essentially the English to the Lingguoren languages in that its grammatical features are similar to the rest of the Lingguoren languages, but the word inventory is heavily distinct from the others.

**Ai, Yue (Southern Lingguoren)**
Each belong to the Southern branch of the Central-Southern Lingguoren languages. Like Anshanese, there is significant differences between Ai/Yue and Standard Lingguoren, but there is higher mutual intelligibility between Ai, Yue, and Anshanese than any of them to Standard Lingguoren.

## Western Lingguoren
**Western Lingguoren**
Primarily spoken in Ganjian, Zuang, and western Jongqu.

**Beidao Lingguoren**
Primarily spoken in the northern islands of Beidao. Highly mutually intelligible with Western Lingguoren but still distinct (primarily through morphology and vocabulary)

## Liyan/Namese
**Namese**
The main language of Nam, and spoken primarily in Nam and Liya. Many signs and newspapers in Nam will have Namese writing alongside the Standard Lingguoren writing.

**Liyan**
A close relation to Namese. Essentially the same as above, but switch out Namese with Liyan. 

## Yumalyan/Ondinian
**Mountain Yumalyan**
The branch/dialect of Yumalyan primarily spoken in the more mountainous regions.

**Valley Yumalyan**
The branch/dialect of Yumalyan primarily spoken in the valleys and steppes.

## Special
**High Tongue/High Elvish**
A language that developed amongst the High Elves after the War of the Corrupted Threads. Essentially a status symbol, though helpful to know once reaching the advanced stages of magical and Ki power, as many books on magic theory use High Tongue. Divided between a literary, formal form and colloquial, spoken form. Basically Fantasy Latin

**Weaverspeak**
A ceremonial language used for casting magic and rituals. Believed to be the most "primordial," though the most comprehensive references to it are in ancient texts and tomes. Some evidence that it is an ancient form of modern Lingguoren, or that ancient Lingguorens' used it for a special ceremonial purpose. Probably the only language on this list that defines the norms of how languages actually work irl in that it has intrinsic magical powers.
