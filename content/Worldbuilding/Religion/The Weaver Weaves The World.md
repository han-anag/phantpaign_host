The origin myth of Qianpath.

### Summary
In the beginning, there was naught but a tangled mass. Disorganized, fraying threads that were wound up tightly, each individual thread fighting each other for space in the constantly moving sphere. Thick knots often resulted from this fighting, and the threads became so caught up in each other that they soon started running out of length.

In the midst of this chaos, emerged a pair of hands. They grasped onto these threads, stopping them from further entangling themselves. Slowly, but surely, they began to untangle the knots and carefully pick them apart. The time it took for them to do this is unknown, but once they had finished, boundless amounts of thread stretched out before them.

The being that had untangled the primordial entanglement, now no longer weighed down and hidden by the tangled threads, fully emerged. They were human in appearance and disposition, but their true abilities far surpassed the common man. As they stood up, a waterfall of vibrant red hair fell down from their head, plummeting to the ground, and trailing off into the distance. Thus was the Weaver Deity.

The Weaver Deity wanted more than untangling messes. They possessed a desire to create, so the Weaver Deity began separating each threadâ€”color, density, thickness, texture, and length were all considerations taken into mind. After separation, the Weaver Deity used their innate powers to summon a loom, and they began to weave. The strongest and most durable threads were the foundation. They were the basis of the universeâ€™s fabric. But to the Weaver Deity, there was no point to making their creation durable, if it had nothing to show for it. They began incorporating the most colorful threads into their weaving, decorating the universe they had just created. Flowing, crystal clear rivers, lands full of rich soil and shining jewels, abundant and fertile greenery, and an assortment of lively and diverse animals. The Weaver Deity sat back and observed their work. It was quite splendid already, and already they were proud of their creation. Satisfied with what they had weaved, the Weaver Deity laid down and slept.

When they woke up, they checked back on their work again. Their weave was still as beautiful as ever, but it was static. The environment was constant, and though it was pretty to look at, after glancing at it only once, the viewer had seen all that it had to offer. There were no hidden messages to be perceived upon multiple viewings, no stories that slowly unraveled their meanings as the viewer looked down the weave. The Weaver Deity despaired at their perceived failure in creation, and looked to their remaining thread for inspiration.

The Weaver Deity found that two kinds of threads remained unused: One that was light, but incredibly flexible, and had a constantly changing array of hues to it. The other heavier and thicker, but when placed next to the former thread, seemed to reflect and amplify its colors. Eager to see what they would result in, the Weaver Deity set to work. They weaved one set of creatures out of the first thread, humans. They weaved a second set of creatures out of the second thread, spirits. The process took them a long time, and by the time they were finished, they were tired enough to need sleep again. Hopeful that their creations would bring more excitement into the universe they had weaved, the Weaver Deity laid down and slept once again.

When they opened their eyes and glanced upon their weave once again, their eyes were alight in surprise. Their creation was as colorful and intricate as before, but its appearance had changed. Colors they recalled being in one place before their slumber had shifted into different spots, previously smooth threads developed texture, and vice versa. As the astounded Weaver Deity moved in closer, they realized the humans and spirits they had created were the driver of these changes. Together, they were shaping the world around them to suit their desires.

The Weaver Deity was quite pleased at their progress, but while the power they had granted the humans and spirits brought them great excitement, they knew that this power could also bring danger. If these creatures were left unchecked, the Weaver knew they could spell disaster for the rest of the universe they had worked so hard to weave.

The Weaver Deity created a new generation of humans and spirits, but weaved them so they existed in a special way. Each individual creature did not exist in a vacuum. They were given threads tying their fates to each other and to the threads around them. While they could resist the pull of the threads that bonded them to each other, to remove themselves too far from their companions would result in them becoming lost to the rest of the universe.

Thus, the Weaver Deity had successfully created the world they desired, ever beautiful and ever developing.

But the original generation of humans and spirits still remained, and with the dangerous powers they had, peace would not last in the world of the Weaver Deity and their creation.
