High Elves are less akin to most of the races in the universe, and more of guardian entities that live mortal lives. They were created by The Weaver to help mortals in the [[War of the Corrupted Threads]]. After the war, the remaining High Elves scattered. Some integrated with mortal societies, taking up roles as religious leaders or spiritual guides. Others formed secluded communities with other High Elves. A rare few decided to live completely alone, remaining with neither mortals, spirits, or other High Elves.

# Basic Information

## Biological Traits
High Elves, like regular elves, have extended life spans compared to most mortals. However, their life spans trump even elves in length. They can live over 1,000 years, and their true life spans remain unknown. High Elves can reproduce like most mortals, but they cannot pass their intrinsic traits to their offspring. Their longer life spans and enhanced powers become dilute, equivalent to normal elves in their children, then half-elves in their grandchildren, etc. The only way for a High Elf's children to retain the full powers of their parents is for the parents to reproduce through magical means.

## Genetics and Reproduction
High Elves, when raising their young, use magic to rapidly mature them in a matter of days. For this reason, most High Elves lack experience with raising children, especially in species' whose young have a very long period of dependency, like humans.

## Dietary Needs and Habits
High Elves have drastically less need for food and water compared to mortals. Indeed, it seems High Elves mostly consume food and drink for pleasure.
