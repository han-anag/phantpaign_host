# Basics
Players have two types of Ki points: Internal Ki and External Ki. Each pool of Ki is equivalent to half their total player level rounded down. For example, a level nine player has four Internal Ki points and four External Ki points, as 4.5 rounded down is four.

Some features can only use one type of Ki. If a feature is unlabeled, assume that it can use either. Using a Ki feature requires a bonus action, unless a feature states otherwise.

For any [[List of Ki Techniques|Ki Techniques]] that require rolling against a save DC, your save DC is your highest base stat modifier + your proficiency bonus + 8.

They reset every long rest, or if a person takes time to meditate (1 hr at the minimum), they gain back one Ki point for every hour meditating.

# Using Ki And Spirits
In making any rolls that involve trying to make an action that involves communicating with [[Spirits (Race)]] that cannot communicate through normal means (i.e. being unable to speak mortal languages), or interacting with the spiritual energy in the environment, the roll is 1d20 + you proficiency bonus modifier. The user can expand Ki points from either pool to add to their Spirit roll.

> [!callout] EX: The party is trying to discern what a stubborn Spirit blocking the road wants. The Spirit cannot communicate in any mortal languages. To help read this enigmatic entity, a level 6 PC, which has a proficiency bonus of +3, expends two Ki points to add +2 to their roll. They would roll a 1d20+5 to read this Spirit's character.
