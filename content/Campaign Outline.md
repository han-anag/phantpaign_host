## The Caochuan Fair
The campaign takes place a few (three) years after the Yumalyan Civil War. The government of Ondinia has been steadily establishing itself after taking over at the end of the war, and the country of Lingguo, where the campaign starts off in, has tentatively started relations with it. However, most of Lingguo is suspicious, or even hostile, of the new country. In the past 20 years, there has been a massive rise in the number of immigrants from Yumaly. Though not talked about enough, most except in the most rural of villages are aware of it.

The major shipping city of Caochuan, situated on the bank of the largest river in the south, hosts a world fair and expo every ten years.

* One of the stands at the fair was a Yumalyan culture organization started by refugees: The Organization for the Cultural Promotion of Yumaly--OCPY
    * Nadyn had stopped here at one point when he was free
#### Leferin and Ondinia
* This year, as a show of solidarity between the newly christened country of Ondinia and Lingguo, the Caochaun fair and science expo decided to partner with some Ondinian inventors and researchers, allowing a select few to have their own presentations at the fair. Behind the scenes, several Ondinian actors pulled some strings to allow Ondinian spies to enter, and notably exiled High Elf necromancer Lauran Howl to have his own presentation.
* The Ondinian government has close relations with Leferin. Leferin is encouraging Ondinia, formerly Yumaly, to ramp up industrialization. Part of this deal includes Leferin supplying their manpower and resources, in exchange for access to a precious chemical in Yumaly’s mountains. The chemical is similar to gunpowder--powdery, and seafoam green in color. It causes massive explosions, and is incredibly dangerous if not handled properly, but over the last decade Leferin has learned to harness its power. As a result, the previously divided country of Leferin has a destructive weapon they could rally behind, and practically worship.
* Leferin’s government has been majorly influenced by military leader General Durand, who has aspirations to take over several countries in order to acquire the resources for Leferin to finally enter an age of lasting peace. His plan is to team up with Ondinia to invade Lingguo, guaranteeing them a crushing defeat.
    * As part of his plan, he has raised several specially selected children to be vessels for the Leferinese gods’ power. He is aware that the Leferinese gods would disapprove of his actions, so he uses the vessels to imitate the gods’ divine powers. The children are raised using a combination of magic and technology to age rapidly, and then in a special blasphemous ritual, are imbued with the essence of a god. The power of a god is so stressful on their mortal bodies that their human (or mortal) minds are sealed away, and they essentially become mindless soldiers. From then on, they are labeled as “Incarnates.” Their mortal minds are essentially reduced to that of a child’s, and in rare moments of lucidity, are as helpless and afraid as an infant without its mother.
        * They too wear special metallic masks, with the face of the god whose power they imitate on them, giving them a sort of Biblically accurate angel Catholic horror appearance.
        * Michael personally witnessed an Incarnate ritual with his mentor in Leferin, Malachi. Both of them were horrified at the sight, with Malachi resolving to voice his heavy dissent to the leaders in charge.
    * For any divine powers that the Incarnates cannot combat, General Durand sends squads to go neutralize or quell them. For example, in temples that serve as communication between the gods and the people, he finds ways to shut them down or destroy them.
    * He also has created special anti-adventuring party squads to go into his target territories and eliminate any potential adventuring parties or mercenaries that may pose a possible threat to his army. They wear blank masks to conceal their identities and use meta strategies such as stacking paladins, and always try to ambush parties when they’re at their weakest. They eventually slaughter several of the other adventuring parties Michael tutors over the course of the story.
* To help support General Durand’s plans, Ondinian spies have infiltrated the Caochuan fair to acquire any technology that can help sustain the immense resources that the Incarnates require. This includes biological engineering technology, instead of outright weapon schematics.
#### Donovan, Mei, and The Marionette Doll’s Binding Vow
* As the party was battling Zephyra in the storeroom, Donovan was outside of the room trying to help others evacuate. As he was doing so, Nadyn snuck up on him and knocked him unconscious with a nearby piece of rubble. After clutching the rock in horror after Donovan collapsed, Nadyn hid behind some rubble. Mei, who had just arrived at the scene, saw Donovan collapse and ran over to help him. 
* When Nadyn hit Donovan in the back of the head with a rock at the Caochaun Fair, he actually mortally injured him. Mei immediately ran up to Donovan and cradled his body as he was dying.
* As she panickedly tried to heal him, tearfully begging Donovan to stay with her, the guardian Marionette Spirit appeared to her.  It spoke to her, as it could tell she cared about Donovan deeply. The Marionette Spirit, who works to protect Donovan’s lineage, made an ultimatum to Mei: It would be able to save Donovan’s life, but at the cost of Mei’s lifespan. If Mei consented to the binding vow, The Marionette Spirit would extract Mei’s life force in order to restore Donovan’s health. From then on, the two’s lives would be intertwined: Should Donovan die, Mei would also, and vice versa. Mei accepted, and The Marionette Doll Spirit carried out the transaction.
* The toll of restoring Donovan to life would render The Marionette Spirit to a form of dormancy. At the start of the campaign onward, it would manifest itself in the plants in Donovan’s apartment and his plant constructs that he builds. She is slowly regaining her strength and imbuing Donovan’s plant constructs with energy, leading to their special intelligence.
    * Donovan notes that his plants only started acting up around the day of the Caochuan fair.
* Nadyn witnessed all of this, and in his shock, accidentally dislodged a piece of rubble, alerting Mei to his presence. Alerted, Mei carefully put Donovan’s body against the wall, still bleeding, and went over to where Nadyn was hiding. She saw the bloodied rock he had near him, and immediately figured out what happened. Enraged, she took out her rapier and pointed it at Nadyn, who began frantically backing up and begging for mercy.
* The party then interceded at this moment.
* Since being magically brought back from the brink of death, Donovan would notice how strange his body feels, and his doctors and friends noted that he recovered remarkably quickly after the traumatic head injury he sustained at the fair.
#### Lauran’s Schemes
* Lauran, to help fund his experiments, struck up a deal with the Ondinian army. He will engineer chimeric soldiers for the army, and in return they will help prop up his experiments. He eventually plans to break away from the deal once he perfects his necromancy though, as he has no interest in helping a military-industrial complex.
* Leferinese scientists have particular interest in Lauran’s experiments, as his research is biological and anatomical in basis, which can help them greatly perfect their Incarnates.
* Over the past several hundred years, Lauran would travel throughout Lingguo getting involved where he would see fit. This has resulted in several towns and cities having stories of a legendary High Elf being their savior, who was actually Lauran in the past.
#### Michael and Anahe’s Past
* Ever since Michael adopted Anahe, he’s been occasionally plagued by mercenaries seemingly going after Anahe. He has easily combated them, but not without them terrorizing Anahe and instilling them both with the fear that one day they’ll successfully take her away from him. Though he’s interrogated him, the mercenaries always state they don’t know the identity of who hired them--They always gave a generic code name and/or wore a mask. Even while Michael has dug into their memories to find out what they witnessed himself, the clients all had varying stature, meaning it was a different person hiring them each time.
* Michael himself has gone into the Ethereal Plane to try and figure out what’s going on. He has gathered that the clients are all puppeteered by one force, but their magic trace is incredibly obfuscated and distorted, making it incredibly difficult to figure who was doing it. The caster was using advanced techniques, such as drawing magic and Ki from the surrounding environment and using it to imbue the puppets with life, instead of directly supplying their own magic. 
* Eventually, as Lauran’s experiments grow more massive in proportion, Michael is able to sense his direction in the Ethereal Plane and start investigating it.
#### The Lost Kingdom and the Four Legendary Artifacts
* Mei is the last known living ancestor of the royal family of an ancient Kingdom in the Southwest of Anshan
    * 翠郭 - Cuìguó, “The Green Kingdom”, “The Verdant Kingdom”, “The Jade Kingdom”
    * Was known for making home in and amongst trees and the quality of its jade, rivaling the mines of Northern Lingguo.
    * They were masters of Environmentalist Magic.
* A group of elders, all children of civilians from the kingdom, are trying to find the fabled last princess of their kingdom, in the hopes they can eventually restore it to its glory.
* One of them notably is a patron for Joanna’s efforts, believing that one of the relics, The Marionette Doll, was made by a member of the kingdom. He is also eager to see the other relics, believing they somehow have a clue to the history of their kingdom.
* The kingdom was started by a group of High Elves, the royal bloodline eventually diluting to become regular Elves, resulting in present day Mei being a Wood Elf.
* The Atracidae were originally founded by a High Elf who had close ties to the kingdom.
## The River of Life 命河
* Ondinia and Leferin are dumping pollutants from the mining of the gunpowder-like ore into the mountains that lead to the River of Life. This notably turns the river scarlet due to the chemicals.
* Donovan is taking a sample of water from the main river that flows throughout Lingguo: It’s name translated as “River of Life.” In the mythos of Lingguo, it’s believed to be the first thread the Weaver placed down. Over 10 cultures along the banks of the river also hold the river as significant in their culture. Over time, he’s noticed the plant life in the river dying off. Furthermore, he’s discovered through conversation with various villagers that the fish in the river have started appearing ill and lower quality. He hopes to give the sample of water to a coworker, and figure out if something is up with the water.
* It is revealed that Ondinia is poisoning the River of Life, and framed the Lingguo government as the perpetrators, by sabotaging a trash disposal facility located near the river. The Atracidae are the only ones truly aware of this.
* The government of Lingguo is desperate to cover up the incident that happened at a trash disposal facility. As Donovan gets closer to the truth, he faces more pressure from the government to stop investigating the river, telling him they have people already handling it.
* Lauran is found in a hidden, secluded village. The villagers are thankful for him because he revived the village elder’s daughter after her death. Though they know the taboo of reviving, their grief was too strong, and they wanted her back, even if it could go horribly wrong. Ever since then, he’s set up his business in the village, providing technology to the villagers and drastically improving their livelihoods. The villagers are reluctant to give up his location, and even fight the party to stop them from reaching him. Secretly, Lauran has been fighting with Ondinia and trying to get them to delay their invasion, since the village lives closer to the Ondinian border.
* Eventually, after the party slays Lauran, Ondinia retaliates by manipulating the Lingguo government to arrest Donovan, steal his plant research, and frame him for the trash disposal facility accident.
* When the party meets with Donovan in his cell, he begs the party to take back the Marionette Doll Leferin forcibly seized from him. Before the party leaves, he offers to tell the party, especially Amanti, everything he knows about the Yumalyan Civil War: How Leferin manipulated the country and wants its resources, how it was behind Ondinia's rise, and how he's heard Ondinia is gathering military might at the Ondinia-Lingguo border.
* He’s brought before the entire country and publicly blamed for his actions. As the soldiers raise the cane to cane him, it shatters. This leads to the crowd and soldiers exclaiming that he is cursed. The crowd of people are encouraged to beat him up and torture him. As a woman smacks him across the face with a pipe, he weakly asks them if they’ve ever wondered why plants are green. The woman hesitates, before Donovan goes on to explain how they’re green because they contain a chemical that absorbs all colors except green. Before he can continue, the woman snaps at Donovan to shut up, and orders the crowd to get him. The people swarm Donovan, and when they’re finally done, his battered and bloodied body remains on the ground. Before Donovan dies, he weakly asks for the party to save the river.
* After Donovan’s death, the party encounters The Atracidae. They ask for Donovan’s body, so they can give him a proper burial. After which, they reveal that they’re fleeing the country: Ondinia is going to invade Lingguo very soon, and they need to retreat for their own safety. Nadyn begs Amanti to join them, and that they shouldn’t stay in the country.
* When the truth of the river is brought to light, and the Lingguo government struggles to do damage control, Ondinia invades the country from the west. Lingguo struggles to fight back, as Ondinia has superior technology lended to them by Leferin.
## **Part I: Hunting Lauran**
The PCs Amanti, Brooks, and Fanna are all eager fair-goers, who happen to take the same boat when traveling to Caochuan. After they dock, an Ondinian spy, disguised as a security guard, asks them if they perform a pat-down. While doing so, the spy steals their tickets, before letting them go.
### The Setup
* The government official offers an ultimatum: The party can come to the capital and serve as investigators for the government’s cause to prove their loyalty.
* Nadyn confesses that he’s the one that attacked Donovan: His boss ordered him to stop Donovan from helping people flee the fair, so he took a nearby rock and smacked Donovan across the side of the head. While he was distracted, however, his boss ran off to avoid being seen.
* After the interrogation, the party comes across a group of people advertising a massive treasure hunt and archeology expedition open to the public. One of the treasures being searched for is the Golden Turtle Claw Crossbow. Another is the legendary marionette doll owned by Donovan. The host reveals she’s part of a cultural exchange with the country of Leferin: Leferin will lend Lingguo some of its technology, and in return Lingguo will allow Leferin to study their artifacts. Unknownst to the host, Leferin plans to keep these artifacts for itself.
    * Golden Turtle Claw Crossbow: Somewhere in Nam, sought after by the Tigers of Nam
    * Marionette Doll: Made by a legendary puppeteer, who's skills were so great that his puppets took on lives of their own.
    * River Dragon's Pearl: Owned by a wealthy businessman. Said to grant the owner power over weather.
    * Loom of the Weaver: An old loom said to have been used by the Weaver herself. Guarded by Brooks' home village up in the mountains. Guarded by a High Elf, Pythia who knew Lauran personally.
* The Leferin Archeological Group approaches Donovan, being the ones to figure out he has the coveted Marionette. He refuses to hand his family heirloom over, even when the Leferins appeal to his scientific side, so they cast Charm Person on him to make him hand it over.
* Lauran is sending people after Anahe to recapture her, and people after Fanna to kill them.
* Nadyn offers to be a spy for the party, to provide them with information on how the Ondinian army is operating.
### The Factory on the River
* As the party is helping the Lingguo government nail down the terrorists, they find out they were partially funded by a wealthy Lingguo businessman. He also is in possession of the River Dragon's Pearl. He works together with Leferin to manufacture goods, and his factory is partially responsible for poisoning the river of life.
    * Boss has a gun that shoots needles that does a small amount of damage at first, and then on the next turn, after a failed CON save, inflicts massive damage.
    * Boss Music: 
* Papers in his pockets indicate correspondence between Ondinia, and a company whose factories operate near the border of Ondinia and Lingguo.
<h3>The Revelations in Anshan (2 Sessions)</h3>
* Mei’s companion on the trip to Anshan is a fellow Atracidae member named Yinghua. She can tell that Mei is still in love with a man, and hopes that she will leave one day to pursue the life she really wants--Upper ranking members of The Atracidae are not allowed to take a partner, as it could interfere with their duties.
* Yinghua tragically perishes trying to save the party. Her body later becomes possessed, forcing the party to kill her.
* First hour
    * Encountering the spirit musician
        * While on the road, the party hears the sound of beautiful erhu music. Upon investigation, or after trying to move on from it, they find an old man playing the erhu on the side of the road, with a bag open for donations. He plays an erhu version of Danny Boy, and after he finishes, asks for a donation. He gets angry that it isn't hell money. When the party is confused as to why he’s only accepting hell money, he goes "Of course I’m a Spirit! You can see me, can’t you!?"
        * He accepts a memory, a secret, or something made with passion and devotion--a craft, trinket, or otherwise, before thanking the party and fading away.
        * In return: He tells the party the story of Cuiguo, The Lost Kingdom.
    * Encountering Meng Po in disguise
        * Next, the party sees a river with a beautiful young woman picking herbs from the riverbank. She implores the party to help her collect herbs from the other shore, promising “a favor” in exchange. Should the party do it, or refuse her help, she transforms into her true form: The old woman Meng Po, the one who serves the soup of forgetfulness to spirits before they are reincarnated.
        * She chuckles and introduces herself, explaining who she is and what role she plays. After a moment of silence, she asks “How is ol’ Haoyu doing?” When the party is confused, she goes “The one who gave you those talismans,” before conjuring a spectral image of him when he was younger.
        * She acts surprised when they explain he has a different name, and explains how she knows him. She has met him a few times before while collecting herbs, and they’ve chatted during those encounters--Mostly her appearing at rivers as he’s traveling, or during funeral rites. She first remembers meeting him after he just ran away from home. She amusingly states that perhaps she’ll put in a request to the Arbiters of Life and Death to give him a longer lifespan, as she has grown to grow fond of him.
        * To pay back the party, she hands them a small bundle of herbs: Eating them grants the effect of a Greater Restoration spell. After that, she bids them farewell, before fading away.
    * Arriving in Donovan’s home village, meeting the spirit medium.
        * Finally, after a long day of travel, the party makes it to a small village. There, they see a spirit medium walking in and out of towns. A lone elderly woman has died, and he is helping attend her funeral. The spirit medium acts polite to the party, but when he notices the talismans Michael had given them, he scowls and warns the party not to interact with him, calling him a demon. When asked to elaborate, he remarks how he heard from the other spirit mediums and priests that Michael is known to have a streak of violence in his past and only changed after Guiying’s father’s intervention. He also mentions a rumor that Michael traded his soul for his immense powerful spirit sensing abilities.
        * The party witnesses a flashback of Donovan in the garden with the statue of past Lauran while his mother sews and watches him.
        * The village is in conflict over whether to let a new visitor--a refugee from Ondinia, take up her new residence. It is only when Donovan’s father speaks up do the village members agree to acquiesce--they work out a deal where Donovan’s father will help take care of the refugee.
* The party reaches the destination at the end of the first session.
* While Yinghua is trapped, she advises the party to go on without her, as the monster is rapidly approaching. As she begs the party to leave her and tell the others what she saw, the monster comes and bites her head, before shaking it roughly in her mouth and flinging it to the side. It roars and gets spit and blood all over the party, initiating combat.
    * Boss Music: 
* In the dust settling after the fight, Yinghua’s corpse ambles over and weakly attempts to slash at the party. The party easily dispatches it, and it falls to the ground like a ragdoll.
### Interlude 1: Plant Bot Fight 2 & Michael’s Echo (3 Sessions)
* Plant Bot Fight 2 (1 Session)
    * Upon arriving back, the party is invited once again to participate in a field test against Donovan’s plant constructs.
* Michael’s Echo (2 Sessions)
    * After coming back from The Atracidae mission with Mei, the party goes to Guiying and asks where Michael is. After she explains he went on a trip to the Spirit World/Ethereal Plane, one of the party members from another party he tutors runs up and begs the party for help--his party got attacked in the Spirit World trying to take down a powerful ghost (Michael's Echo), and he needs help rescuing them.
    * The party wanted to venture into the spirit world after seeing an adventuring gig that would reward them a large sum of money for killing a ghost. It includes a blurry picture of the ghost, wearing robes and having long hair.
    * Music: 
    * The party eventually finds Michael’s echo at the bottom of a massive chasm. They find the injured and bloodied bodies of the other adventuring party there, and the member of the party (Liu) runs up to his fellow adventurers. After doing so, the party sees a blur slash at him, and he coughs up blood before falling over. When the party rushes up to him to help, he weakly tells the party to run, before Michael’s Echo reveals itself and approaches the party.
        * Boss Music: 
### The Corruption in Nam (2 Sessions)
* The Golden Turtle Claw Crossbow is held by the current leader of the Tigers of Nam, who is being influenced by Leferin.
* Prompted to come here after Michael’s encouragement to investigate Fanna’s Echo, settle things with the Tigers, and find the Golden Turtle Claw Crossbow.
* The party works together with one of the other Michael adventuring parties during this time.
    * Boss Music:  
    * Boss Music: 
### Interlude 2: The Binding Vow Revealed (1 ½ Sessions)
* While in the capital, the party witnesses Mei arguing with Michael over Nadyn on the riverbank. Donovan is also present and looks visibly uncomfortable.
* During the argument, when Michael defends Nadyn and says how he is resolving to change his ways and redeem himself--”The man he is now is different from the man he was before”-- Mei calls him irredeemable and accidentally lets slip that Nadyn killed Donovan.
    * Music: 
* The air immediately becomes cold with tension, as Michael slowly asks Mei to repeat what she just said. Mei grows pale and immediately turns tail and runs, while Michael immediately chases after her.
* Donovan, in horror, turns to Nadyn and shakily asks if this is true. Nadyn weakly says “I’m sorry.” Donovan immediately starts having a breakdown--His life is a fake, he is a violation against nature, he should be dead--as Nadyn panics and tries to subdue him, but only makes things worse. Donovan tries throwing himself into the river, but Nadyn grabs him and holds him back. Donovan wriggles free, spitting hatred at Nadyn for killing him, and draws his gun. Nadyn uses magic to knock away the gun, and the two end up clawing and punching at each other. Nadyn gets triggered into an aggressive state from his trauma in the war and instinctively tries drowning Donovan in the river. It is only when Anahe intervenes and puts the two to sleep with her emotion manipulating magic does the scene stop. The stress of stopping Donovan and Nadyn puts Anahe into an anxiety attack as well.
* The two wait for Michael and Mei to return, only for Michael to appear out of the bushes, covered in leaves and scratches. He swears, and asks the party to go after her, as she had evaded him by masking her aura trace with plant life--Practitioners of environmentalist magic are masters of stealth and reconnaissance. Meanwhile, he’ll take Nadyn and Donovan back to the capital and figure out what to do from there.
* The party ventures into the wilderness to fight Mei, finding her in the ruins of a Cuiguo ritual site--A place that she retreats to when she wants to be at peace and meditate. She refuses to go back to the others, forcing the party to fight her.
    * Boss Music: 
    * At her defeat, Mei holds a hand up and begs the party to stop hurting her, as hurting her will hurt Donovan too. She reveals how their lives are linked, and divulges what happened at the fair. After finishing her story, she breaks down into tears lamenting how men get away with everything and leave the women to clean up after them.
        * Music: 
* While in the capital, Michael leaves Nadyn and Donovan under watch of Anahe, while Mei and him go to the Eastern Shengdu Temple to talk with Guiying and her father for advice. Mei begs Michael to let her stay with Donovan, and he promises her that he’ll allow her to spend as much time as she wants with him, but that figuring out what exactly happened during the Binding Vow is more important.
* Shortly after, Nadyn and Anahe realize Donovan ran away, using his Artificer magic knowledge to create a decoy of him to leave behind and plants to mask his aura trace. Anahe previously checked up on the two every 15 minutes or so, and in the time between her checking up on him, Donovan figured out how to create a decoy of himself and escape through the window. They ask the party to help them catch him. After interviewing several witnesses--possibly Iskra, Ljubica, and Laseen--they all reveal they saw a bedraggled man stumbling towards the transportation center. The party, Nadyn, and Anahe arrive just in time to see Donovan step into a teleportation portal and disappear.
### The Ill Omen in Jùnyán 峻岩 (2 Sessions)
* The Loom of the Weaver is guarded by Pythia. Pythia doesn't relinquish the Loom until the party defeats him in an honorable fight.
    * Boss Music 1:  
    * Boss Music 2:  
* Donovan is found hiding out in a cave in Junyun, feverishly working on his plant constructs. In his mania, he reveals how sick he is of his constructs being used for warfare and tells the party how once he perfects the plant constructs, he will jump off a mountain cliff and return himself to The Weave as intended.
    * Boss Music 1: 
    * Boss Music 2: 
* Mei and Michael are revealed to have teleported in, and take Donovan back to the capital with them.
    * Music: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTq8TQRfQyE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTq8TQRfQyE)
* After fighting Donovan, the village becomes under attack from a monster that escaped from the Ondinian border, prompting all the villagers to fight it. The party witnesses Pythia come in and slay the monster, before returning to their position guarding the Loom of the Weaver.
* Eventually, the village comes under attack from the Ondinian border once again, this time augmented by technology. The villagers all make preparations to flee, except for Pythia, who stands steadfast at the entrance to where the Loom is held.
* Before Pythia dies, he announces a prophecy that disaster is imminent, with a threat so fearsome that even the gods wouldn’t be able to help. He also tells them to use the keystone held in his chest to teleport back to Shengdu--where the party will land in the Eastern Shengdu Temple. That way, they will safely escape from Junyan’s destruction. After his body fades, the party takes the keystone left behind and uses it to enter the storeroom where the Loom is kept.
### Interlude 3: Haoyu Yang and The Ghost Wedding (2 Sessions)
* While back in the city, the party is allowed time to check up on the other NPCs they know: Iskra and Ljubica, Laseen and her family, Guiying and her father, Cillian and Sangshu, etc.
* When visiting the temple, they notice Guiying and Michael have a conversation, as a government official and Anahe watch. After that, the government official leads Michael away. Anahe begs to go with him, and Michael tries to tell her how she can’t, but to his surprise, the government official lets her come with. They notice the Ghost Bride hovering prominently over him, and she whispers to the party “Find… Me…” before disappearing.
* Guiying looks shocked at the news, before pondering on what the Ghost Bride wanted. Upon being asked for more information on the Ghost Bride, she reveals how she’s from a traumatic event in Michael’s past. She reassures them that the Ghost Bride is not malevolent, but has been a mysterious constant in his life for years.
* She offers to let the party teleport after Michael and the official, and pursue the Ghost Bride to see what’s up.
* Just then, she receives a vision telling her that the party should make whatever preparations they want to know, because they might not return from their journey should they pursue the Ghost Bride.
* The party eventually finds the village where Michael and the official are: There, they see him in his traditional robes, acting as a servant for a family there.
* While there, they hear the whispers of the Ghost Bride beckoning the party to find her once more. When they reach where she is, she traps the party in a massive flashback sequence, taking up the entirety of one session.
* Michael sighs, lights a cigarette and uses it, before going on to explain the past incident to his party--The Ghost Bride haunting him, finding out about Ergou Wang’s crime, vowing to kill him in revenge, and the fallout.
    * Music: 
* The day after Michael tells the party his story, it is revealed Lauran took Anahe in the brief hour that Michael slept. Enraged, he vows to chase after him and take her back, sending a message to Guiying explaining what happened and that he may not return. Guiying is in shock, and asks if Michael has anyone helping him. He answers how the party won’t let him go by himself, so they’re coming along. Frustrated at his stubbornness, she calls him a fool and tells him she’s sending help after him. Michael tries to protest, but she hangs up.
### Confronting Lauran (1 ½ Sessions)
* As the party moves forward, Donovan and Mei walk in from the forest--after Mei fast-traveled her and Donovan there. They reveal Guiying sent them after him to help protect him. Michael is shocked, saying how he thought the two disliked him. They reveal how though they’ve disagreed with some of his personality traits or methods, they still respect him greatly, and know how deeply he cares for Anahe.
* Michael, Mei, and Donovan agree to work together to rescue Anahe. They clear the hordes of undead so the party can focus on Lauran.
    * Music: 
* Lauran refers to Michael by his old name, and uses family names first: Yang Haoyu, Yu Mei, and Lufei Donovan.
    * Boss Music 1: 
    * Boss Music 2: 
* During the fight, Lauran manages to trap Donovan, and prepares to fire a lethal Disintegrate beam at him. Mei attempts to pull him out, but the Disintegrate beam is moving faster than her and Donovan can outpace. Michael ends up leaping in front of them and taking the Disintegrate beam for them, breaking all of his protection talismans and turning nearly half his body into dust. Michael’s disfigured appearance notably resembles when his Echo’s form started to break down after the party dealt damage to it.
* After Lauran’s defeat, the next day, upon entering the closest city, Donovan is seized by authorities and forcibly taken to Shengdu.
## Misc Stuff
* Donovan and Cillian are both from Anshan, the province to the east of Fengtian. Anshan is known for having the largest biological diversity in the country. However, its inhabitants are stereotyped as being backwards country hicks, dumb, and old-fashioned. Donovan hides that he’s from Anshan, even though the beautiful nature of the province inspired him to become a scientist.
* Anshan is a fusion of Yunnan and Ireland - Chinese-Celtic fusion music, Irish folk songs (Danny Boy, The Parting Glass)
* Anshan’s real life parallel is Yunnan.
* Yue and Liya are inspired by Cantonese culture, with Vietnamese culture supplementing Liya and Hakka culture supplementing Yue.
* Encounter with spirit craftsmen: musicians, tailors, jade workers, etc. reveals the plot of Cuiguo
* Lights and illumination are a prominent theme throughout Leferin: They enjoy sightseeing stars, have festivals where people burn effigies and pray for luck in the new year, love fireflies, etc.
* Ai is infamous for its spicy food - mirrors Sichuan
* When a being reaches a certain point, its Ki and environmental Spirit can intermingle to the point that they begin to take on a life of their own, with the being’s self as a frame of reference, known as an **Echo**.
    * One of the modes of upkeep Michael has to do is be vigilant for any of his Echos that appear. They often tend to be incredibly powerful, and often violent, causing him to take it upon himself to ensure they never cause any trouble/
